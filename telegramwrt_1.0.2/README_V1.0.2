# TelegramWrt

TelegramWrt is a modular package for OpenWrt that integrates a Telegram bot with advanced diagnostics, monitoring, and remote control capabilities. Each plugin is designed to be extensible, reproducible, and compatible across multiple architectures.

## 📦 Requirements

Before using TelegramWrt, make sure the following packages are installed:<pre>
opkg update
opkg install wget
opkg install jq
opkg install curl
opkg install bash
opkg install tcpdump


⚙️ Initial Configuration
After installation, configure the bot by editing the file:
vi /usr/lib/TelegramWrt/config


Insert your TOKEN and CHATID:

TOKEN="123456789:ABCdefGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz"
CHAT_ID="987654321"


# 🔐 The TOKEN is generated via BotFather on Telegram. The CHATID can be retrieved by sending a message to the bot and reading the response via logging or diagnostic plugins.

# 🚀 Installation
Install the .ipk package with:
opkg install /tmp/telegramwrt_1.0.2_all.ipk


The package installs the bot and all plugins under /usr/lib/TelegramWrt/.

# 📤 Usage Example

Once configured, send a command to the bot:
/status


# 🔁 Automatic Bot Startup

To ensure that TelegramWrt starts automatically every time your OpenWrt device reboots, add the following command to the rc.local file:
bash /usr/lib/TelegramWrt/telegram.sh &

# or 
sh /usr/lib/TelegramWrt/telegram.sh &

# 📌 Steps:

Open the rc.local file with a text editor:

vi /etc/rc.local

Insert the command before the line exit 0:

bash /usr/lib/TelegramWrt/telegram.sh &
# News v1.0.2 message_reboot
bash /usr/lib/TelegramWrt/plugins/message_router &
# or 
sh /usr/lib/TelegramWrt/plugins/message_router &

Save and exit (ctrt+c, then :wq!).

# ✅ The & symbol is essential: it runs the bot in the background, preventing it from blocking the boot process.

# 🖥️ Installing TelegramWrt with WinSCP
